# Objective
Teach students the importance of motivation and mindset.
Students should be able to:
- recall, understand and employ mindsets that promote healthy learning.
- name their key motivation, describe the growth mindset and apply the learning process successfully.
- know what to do when they're stuck.
- manage their study time.
Students should understand and avoid the common pitfalls that come with learning.
# Questions
Students should be able to answer these questions:
- What is the key difference between a fixed mindset and a growth mindset when encountering programming challenges?
- What are the two modes your mind switches between during the learning process, and how do they differ?
- When youâ€™re stuck on a programming problem, what three main strategies can you employ to help?
# Motivation
- Ask students what their motivation is for joining the club and why they want to be a programmer
- Questions to ask are:
    Do you want to have a fulfilling career that pays well?
    Are you excited by the creative outlet programming provides?
    Are you determined to develop the skills and abilities to build any app you can think of?
    Do you want to start your own company by turning an app idea into reality?
- Growth mindset; someone with the fixed mindset does things once and if they fail, they don't try again. Someone with the growth mindset believes they can improve and succeed with consistent effort.
- Focus mode and Diffuse mode, where focus mode is when you're learning, reading, or working on projects, and diffuse mode is when you're not.

# What to do when stuck
- Google it, take a break, or ask for help.

# Managing your time
- Put consistent time in, not once a week
- Study at a specific time, with a goal
- How fast you learn depends on your previous knowledge, not how smart you are
- You have to find your own pace, set your own deadlines

# Pitfalls
- Procrastination; use the pomodoro timer to set breaks
- Not taking breaks; take breaks often
- Distractions; move to a different room, turn off everything other than what you need
- Comparing yourself to others; only compare yourself to your past self
- Don't take programming notes! use docs
